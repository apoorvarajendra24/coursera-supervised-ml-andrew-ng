# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

This repository contains my work from the Coursera course **"Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification"** offered by **DeepLearning.AI** and taught by **Andrew Ng**.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

This course is part of the **Machine Learning Specialization** and introduces the foundational concepts of **Supervised Learning** using:

- **Regression** (Linear, Polynomial)
- **Classification** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- **Loss functions** (MSE, Cross-Entropy)
- **Gradient Descent and Optimization**
- **Evaluation metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- **Overfitting and Regularization (L2, L1)**

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Implemented linear and logistic regression from scratch.
- Applied vectorization and broadcasting using NumPy.
- Used regularization techniques to avoid overfitting.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Developed intuition for bias-variance tradeoffs.
